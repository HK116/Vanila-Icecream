# Vanilla Ice Cream Cone Rain

A visually rich, interactive vanilla ice cream cone rain animation inspired by [corndog.io](https://corndog.io), built with vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas for smooth performance.

## Features

- Diagonal cone rain flowing from the top-left to bottom-right with a natural sway effect.
- Multiple vanilla ice cream cone flavors: vanilla, chocolate, mint, and rainbow.
- Flavor toggle dropdown to choose a specific cone flavor or randomize cones.
- Realistic depth illusion by scaling cones based on depth.
- Maintains correct aspect ratio for each flavor's unique image shape.
- Uses canvas rendering for smooth, high-performance animation.
- Responsive canvas resizes with the browser window.
